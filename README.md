# BeerChamps

Student bars in Innsbruck organize Beerpong tournaments on a regular basis. Until now, one person
was responsible for the administration of the tournament, who manually performed every data entry,
evaluation and calculation. Our tournament management app is an automated approach that assists
in the management of these tournaments. The finished product allows organizers to quickly create
and manage tournaments. The application offers the possibility to create teams and enter the result
of a game. The application will automatically calculate the games for each round of the tournament.
